			<p>Establishments that are inspected can pass, pass with conditions or fail.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>A <strong class='label-red'>fail</strong> is given if an establishment has serious violations that can't be fixed during the inspection and remain uncorrected during a re-inspection. See more below about serious violations. A fail also occurs when an establishment has critical violations that can't be corrected during inspection. In this situation, the establishment will have its license suspended until it passes a reinspection.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>A <strong class='label-yellow'>pass with conditions</strong> is given if the establishment has serious or critical violations that are corrected during the inspection or the certified food service sanitation manager isn't present during the inspection. (The manager is someone who works for the restaurant and oversees the food-handling process, to make sure food is handled to prevent the occurrence of food-borne illness. The manager's certification must be prominently posted).</p></li>
        
        <li><p>A <strong class='label-green'>pass</strong> is given if the establishment meets minimum city requirements and doesn't have serious or critical violations present during the inspection.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong class='label-purple'>Out of business</strong> means the establishment was out of business at the time of the inspection.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Risk</strong>: Each establishment is categorized as to its risk of adversely 
      affecting the public's health, with 1 being the highest and 3 the lowest. The frequency of 
      inspection is tied to this risk, with risk 1 establishments inspected most frequently and 
      risk 3 least frequently.</p> 
      
      <p><strong>Violations</strong>: An establishment can receive one or more of 45 distinct violations (violation 
      numbers 1-44 and 70). For each violation number listed for a given establishment, the 
      requirement the establishment must meet in order for it to NOT receive a violation is 
      noted, followed by a specific description of the findings that caused the violation to be 
      issued. </p>  
      
      <p>Generally speaking, inspectors focus on food-handling practices, product temperatures, server hygiene, facility maintenance and pest control. Inspections usually occur every six months.</p>

			<p>Food inspections are pretty interesting. It's also good to know what restaurants have failed. Plus, I like to make maps.</p>
			<h2 id="where-did-you-get-your-data-from">Where did you get your data from?</h2>
			<p>The data comes from Chicago's <a href='https://webapps.cityofchicago.org/healthinspection/General_Info.jsp'>Department of Public Health's Food Protection Program</a> inspections which can be found at: </p>

			<p>This site is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Google's Fusion Tables and Maps API. The data is stored in Fusion Tables and is updated every night by a <a href='https://github.com/derekeder/Socrata-to-FusionTables'>PHP script I wrote</a> to import the data directly from the <a href='http://data.cityofchicago.org/'>City of Chicago Data Portal</a>.</p>
